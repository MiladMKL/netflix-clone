# Netflix Clone

A simple Netflix clone built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, NextAuth and Movie Database (TMDB).

## About

Introducing a Netflix clone project, created using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The project sources movie and TV show data from the Movie Database (TMDB). The app features a sleek design similar to Netflix's streaming service, allowing users to browse popular movies and TV shows and watch trailers. Additionally, the app is designed to be mobile-responsive.

I developed this project as a way to enhance my web development skills and explore the capabilities of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. As I continue to hone my web development skills, this project serves as a valuable example of how these tools can be leveraged to produce high-quality results.

Note: Although the app has a functional authentication feature with NextAuth, it has been disabled for demonstration purposes.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it as needed. Thank you for taking an interest in my Netflix clone project.
